**Summary:** Urbanization is one of the great challenges and opportunities of this century, inextricably tied to global challenges ranging from climate change to sustainable use of energy and natural resources, and from personal health and safety to accelerating innovation and education. There is a growing science community—spanning nearly every discipline—pursuing research related to these challenges. For many urban questions, however, there is a need for measurements with greater spatial and/or temporal resolution than is currently available for understanding air quality, microclimate, vibration, noise, and other factors. Concurrently, many measurements—from the flow of people through a public space to the impact of at-grade rail crossings on emergency response—require more sophisticated “measurements” involving embedded, or “edge” computing within the urban infrastructure. Catlett will discuss the Array of Things initiative that Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago are doing in partnership with the City of Chicago and a growing number of cities around the world, involving novel remotely programmable embedded measurement systems.   Catlett will also discuss efforts to build computational models encompassing multiple facets of cities, ranging from transportation to weather to energy to social-economic factors.

**Charlie Catlett** is the founding director of the Urban Center for Computation and Data, UrbanCCD, which brings social, physical, and computational scientists together with artists, architects, technologists, and policy makers to explore urban dynamics and design. He is also a Senior Computer Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and a Senior Fellow at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation at The University of Chicago.
From 2007 to 2011 he was the Chief Information Officer at Argonne National Laboratory, and from 2004 to 2007 he was Director of the National Science Foundation's TeraGrid initiative - a nationally distributed supercomputing facility involving fifteen universities and federal laboratories. From 1999 to 2004 Charlie directed the design and deployment of I-WIRE, a dedicated fiber optic network funded by the State of Illinois, which connects research institutions in the Chicago area and downstate Illinois to support advanced research and education. In recent years he has created a new form of urban measurement infrastructure, the "Array of Things," implementing new sensing and edge computing technologies.
Before joining the University of Chicago and Argonne in 2000, Charlie was Chief Technology Officer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. Beginning at NCSA’s founding in 1985 he participated in the development of NSFNET, one of several early national networks that evolved into what we now experience as the Internet. During the exponential growth of the web following the release of NCSA’s Mosaic web browser, his team developed and supported NCSA’s scalable web server infrastructure.
Recognized one of 25 “Doers, Dreamers & Drivers” of 2016 by Government Technology magazine and in 2014 as one of Chicago’s “Tech 50” technology leaders by Crain’s Chicago Business, Charlie is a Computer Engineering graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
